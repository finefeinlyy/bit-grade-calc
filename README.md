# BIT Grade Calculator Web

This project marks my first experience in learning and creating a website using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, which I developed in **June 2024**. I created a **Grade Calculator** web application to address a pain point I and my friends faced when using other grade calculator websites â€” the tedious task of manually entering subject names, credit hours, and grades for each calculation.

## Features
- **Predefined Terms and Subjects**: Users can select the term and academic year, which automatically loads the subjects and their corresponding credit hours.
- **Dropdown for Grades**: Instead of typing grades manually, a dropdown menu makes the process quicker and more error-free.
- **Simplified User Experience**: Eliminates the need to repeatedly input subject names and credit hours, making the calculation process faster and more efficient.

## Motivation
The idea was born out of frustration with existing grade calculators that required excessive input fields. This tool was specifically designed for my study group to make grade calculations straightforward and efficient.

## Hosting
The website is live at [https://puenyerjingjing.com/](https://puenyerjingjing.com/), where my friends and I actively use it. While the interface might not be the most visually appealing, the functionality and practicality have proven to be extremely beneficial.

## Lessons Learned
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
- Structuring a web application using **HTML**.
- Styling with **CSS** to create a clean layout.
- Adding interactivity and functionality with **JavaScript**.
- Deploying a live website for real-world use.

Although the website is simple, it has served its purpose well and has been a significant learning experience for me.
